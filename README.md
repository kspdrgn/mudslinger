Mudslinger is a web based MUD client written in Typescript. 
It consists of a Node.js / Express web server and a HTML/CSS/Javascript frontend.

The Node.js server makes telnet connections to the target host/port and acts as a telnet proxy for the frontend application.

It can be configured to connect only to a specific host/port or allow connections to any host/port.
